## REST Client
REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, 
making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, 
are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. 
We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web.

##Retrofit
Retrofit is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. 
We’ll not go into the details of Retrofit 1.x versions and jump onto 
Retrofit 2 directly which has a lot of new features and a changed internal API compared to the previous versions.
Retrofit 2 by default leverages OkHttp as the networking layer and is built on top of it.

Retrofit automatically serialises the JSON response using a POJO(Plain Old Java Object) 
which must be defined in advanced for the JSON Structure. To serialise JSON we need a converter to convert 
it into Gson first. We need to add the following dependencies in our build.grade file.

## Conclusion
The development of this application done by using Software Android Studio in android programming language with java. 
HOSTEL BOOKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is very useful for students want to stay in hostel. 
It helps the student to find nearby hostel easily simply downloading android application in their mobile. 
This hostel management software is designed for people who want to manage various activities in the hostel.
For the past few years the numbers of educational institutions are increasing rapidly. It helps to avoid human manual paper works.
To Complete this project I have meet all the requirements.
